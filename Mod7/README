HashMap
For this assignment, you will be coding an ExternalChainingHashMap, a key-value HashMap with an external chaining collision resolution strategy. A HashMap maps unique keys to values and allows O(1) average case lookup of a value when the key is known. The table should not contain duplicate keys, but can contain duplicate values. In the event of trying to add a duplicate key, replace the value in the existing (key, value) pair with the new value and return the old value.

IMPORTANT:

You will be given 5 attempts on this assignment, with a 30 minute cooldown between submissions.
Please run your code before each submission to ensure that there are no formatting errors! If there are formatting errors in your code, your code will not be graded and a submission attempt will be logged. For more information, please review the Vocareum overview below.
Capacity
The starting capacity of the ExternalChainingHashMap using the default constructor should be the constant INITIAL_CAPACITY defined in ExternalChainingHashMap.java. Reference the constant as-is. Do not simply copy the value of the constant. Do not change the constant. Do not regrow the backing array when removing elements.

If adding to the table would cause the load factor (LF) to exceed (i.e. greater than, not greater than or equal to) the max load factor constant provided in the java file, the table should be resized to have a capacity of 2n + 1, where n is the current capacity before adding the parameterized element. See the javadocs for specific instructions on when to resize. There is a method called resizeBackingTable that you should use for resizing.

Hash and Compression Functions
You should not write your own hash functions for this assignment. Instead, use the hashCode() method that every Object has. For the compression function, mod by table length first, then take the absolute value (it must be done in this order to prevent overflow in certain cases). As a reminder, you should be using the hashCode() method on only the keys (and not the ExternalChainingMapEntry object itself) since that is what is used to look up the values. After converting a key to an integer with a hash function, the integer must be compressed to fit in the array backing the HashMap.

Adding
When adding a key/value pair to a HashMap, add the pair to the front of the chain in the correct position. Also remember that keys are unique in a HashMap, so you must ensure that duplicate keys are not added. Each index of the table should point to an ExternalChainingMapEntry that represents the head of a linked list. That linked list contains all elements that collide at that index.

Removing
When removing a key/value pair from a HashMap using external chaining, you can safely remove the item. Removing from a chain is very similar to removing from a Singly-Linked List, treating the first table entry as the head, so refer to your notes and homework assignments from earlier in the course if you need a refresher. As usual, if the entry you are removing is the only entry at that index, you should make sure to null out that spot rather than leaving it there.



General Tips
When removing an element from a chain, think about how removing the head differs from removing an element inside the chain, in terms of the backing table.
We highly recommend copying the starter code and working in your preferred IDE in order to have access to features such as code completion, auto-formatting, and much more!
Here are general assignment guidelines that should be followed.

Do not include any package declarations in your classes.
Do not change any existing class headers, constructors, instance/global variables, or method signatures. For example, do not add throws to the method headers since they are not necessary. Instead, exceptions should be thrown as follows: throw new InsertExceptionHere("Error: some exception was thrown");
All helper methods you choose to write should be made private. Recall the idea of Encapsulation in Object-Oriented Programming!
Do not use anything that would trivialize the assignment. (e.g. Don't import/use java.util.ArrayList for an ArrayList assignment.)
Always be very conscious of efficiency. Even if your method is to be , traversing the structure multiple times is considered inefficient unless that is absolutely required (and that case is extremely rare).
If applicable, use the generic type of the class; do not use the raw type of the class. For example, use new LinkedList<Integer>() instead of new LinkedList().
 Use of the following statements should be avoided at all times.

package	System.arraycopy()	clone()
assert()	Arrays class	Array class
Thread class	Collections class	Collection.toArray()
Reflection APIs	Inner or nested classes	Lambda Expressions
The Vocareum (code editor) interface has six main components:

The Drop-Down in the top left. This lets you choose from multiple available files. Note that this drop-down will only be visible in assignments that require multiple files.
The Run button. This will compile your code and run a file scan. Running your code will not count towards your total allowed submission attempts, therefore you are free to run as many times as needed.
The Submit button. This will compile your code, run a file scan, grade your assignment, and output results to console. Note that for most assignments in this class, you will only be allowed a limited number of submissions. A submission is counted when the submit button is clicked, regardless of whether or not your code can compile or if there are any file issues. Therefore, we highly recommend that you run your code before submitting to ensure that there are no issues that will prevent your code from being graded and that every submission attempt will generate meaningful results.
The Reset button. This will revert all your changes and reset your code to the default code template.
The Code Window. This is where you will write your code. For large coding assignments, we highly recommend copying the starter code and working in your preferred IDE to have access to features such as code completion, auto-formatting, and much more!
The Output Window. This window will appear whenever you run or submit your code and will display the output for you to view.
